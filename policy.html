								<h3>Public Comments on Agency Rulemaking</h3>
								<p>As part of my graduate studies, I have written public comments in response to proposed federal agency rules. <a href="gradschool.html" target="blank"></a> See my Graduate School tab for more information.</p>

								<h3>STEM Education Events and Communication Undergraduate Fellow</h3>
								<p>The Helmsley STEM Education program through the Yale Center for Teaching and Learning is dedicated to the research and development of effective practices in teaching STEM fields. As the undergraduate fellow, my role was assisting the program director on website maintenance and updates, planning upcoming events including the STEM education journal club and lecture series, and professionally communicating with educators and researchers in STEM.</p>

								<h4>NASA Office of International and Interagency Relations Intern</h4>
								<p>In the spring of 2017, I decided to apply my background in STEM to work in policy by taking a semester off as an at NASA Headquarters in Washington, DC. At NASA, I worked in the Office of International and Interagency Relations to help develop NASA's global partnerships relevent to the goals of the organization. Although I was an intern, I took on many of the responsibilities a civil servant in the office would have, including drafting and negotiating agreements with foreign partners, communicating with both international government and commericial organizations to plan seminars and conferences, and briefing NASA's senior officials on upcoming meetings and trips. During my time in DC, I also represented NASA and my office as a volunteer judge at several local science fairs and other community outreach events. It is my goal to pursue other opportunities similar to this internship in the future that involve my interests in both STEM and public policy.</p>
